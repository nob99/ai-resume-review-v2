# Backend Architecture Migration - Status Report

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-07 22:10 JST  
**Current Sprint**: Sprint 004  
**Migration Phase**: Phase 1 (Auth) - In Progress  
**Risk Level**: 🟢 Low (feature flags enable instant rollback)

## 🎯 Migration Overview

We are migrating the backend from a technical-layer architecture to a feature-based architecture using the **Strangler Fig Pattern** - building new alongside old with gradual cutover and zero downtime.

### Key Documents
- **Architecture Design**: `backend_architecture_redesign.md`
- **Migration Plan**: `backend_migration_plan.md`
- **AI Guidance**: `CLAUDE.md`

## 📊 Current Status Summary

| Phase | Feature | Status | Feature Flag | Default | Production Ready |
|-------|---------|--------|--------------|---------|------------------|
| **Phase 0** | Infrastructure | ✅ Complete | N/A | N/A | Yes |
| **Phase 1** | Auth | 🔄 In Progress | `USE_NEW_AUTH` | `false` (old) | No |
| **Phase 2** | Upload | 📅 Not Started | `USE_NEW_UPLOAD` | `false` | No |
| **Phase 3** | AI Agents | 📅 Not Started | `USE_NEW_AI` | `false` | No |
| **Phase 4** | Resume Review | 📅 Not Started | N/A | N/A | No |

## ✅ Phase 0: Infrastructure Foundation (COMPLETE)

### What Was Built
```
backend/app/
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── persistence/
│   │   ├── postgres/
│   │   │   ├── base.py          # BaseRepository with CRUD operations
│   │   │   └── connection.py    # PostgreSQL connection pooling
│   │   └── redis/
│   │       ├── connection.py    # Redis connection management
│   │       └── cache.py         # Cache service with TTL
│   └── storage/
│       ├── interface.py         # Storage protocol/interface
│       └── providers/
│           └── local.py         # Local filesystem provider
└── ai_agents/
    └── interface.py             # AI service protocol
```

### Key Components
- **BaseRepository**: Generic CRUD operations with async support
- **Connection Management**: PostgreSQL and Redis with pooling
- **Storage Abstraction**: Provider-agnostic file storage
- **AI Interface**: Protocol for future AI service decoupling

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR USE** - All infrastructure components are tested and functional

## 🔄 Phase 1: Auth Migration (IN PROGRESS - 40% Complete)

### Current State
- ✅ **Code Written**: New auth feature structure created
- ✅ **Feature Flag**: `USE_NEW_AUTH` environment variable implemented  
- ✅ **Backwards Compatible**: Old auth still works (and is the default)
- ❌ **Not Tested**: New auth not tested with real database
- ❌ **Not Deployed**: Still in development environment

### File Structure Created
```
backend/app/features/auth/
├── models.py       # User + RefreshToken SQLAlchemy models
├── schemas.py      # Pydantic schemas for API
├── repository.py   # UserRepository + RefreshTokenRepository
├── service.py      # AuthService with business logic
├── api.py         # New auth endpoints
└── tests/         # Co-located tests (empty, needs migration)
```

### Feature Flag Usage
```bash
# To use OLD auth (current default)
USE_NEW_AUTH=false python app/main.py

# To use NEW auth (for testing)
USE_NEW_AUTH=true python app/main.py
```

### What Works
- ✅ Both old and new auth modules import successfully
- ✅ Feature flag routing in `main.py` works
- ✅ Old auth tests still pass (16/16)

### What Needs to Be Done
1. **Test New Implementation** ⚠️ CRITICAL
   - Run integration tests with `USE_NEW_AUTH=true`
   - Fix any bugs found
   - Validate against real database

2. **Migration Schedule** (from `backend_migration_plan.md`)
   - [ ] Day 4: Test in Development 
   - [ ] Day 5: Deploy to Staging (100% traffic)
   - [ ] Day 6: Production (10% traffic)
   - [ ] Day 7: Production (100% traffic)
   - [ ] Day 10: Remove old code

3. **Test Migration**
   - [ ] Copy tests from `tests/auth/` to `app/features/auth/tests/`
   - [ ] Update imports to use new structure
   - [ ] Ensure 80%+ coverage

## 🚧 Known Issues & Risks

### Current Issues
1. **New auth untested** - May have runtime errors
2. **Missing imports** - Some security functions may need adjustment
3. **Database session management** - New async session handling untested

### Mitigation
- Feature flags allow instant rollback (`USE_NEW_AUTH=false`)
- Old code unchanged and working
- Can test in isolation before any production exposure

## 📋 Handover Checklist

### For Engineers Taking Over

#### Immediate Priority
1. **Test the new auth implementation**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   USE_NEW_AUTH=true python -m pytest tests/auth/ -v
   ```
   
2. **Fix any failing tests** - Likely issues:
   - Database session management
   - Import paths
   - Async/await handling

3. **Create comparison script** to validate old vs new behavior:
   ```python
   # Compare responses from old and new auth
   # Both should return identical results
   ```

#### Environment Setup
```bash
# Required environment variables
USE_NEW_AUTH=false      # Keep false until tested
DATABASE_URL=...        # PostgreSQL connection
REDIS_URL=...          # Redis connection
SECRET_KEY=...         # JWT secret (change in production!)
```

#### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test OLD auth (should pass)
USE_NEW_AUTH=false python -m pytest tests/auth/

# Test NEW auth (needs fixing)
USE_NEW_AUTH=true python -m pytest tests/auth/

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/auth/AUTH-001_user_login/unit/ -v
```

## 🎯 Next Steps Priority Order

1. **URGENT**: Test and fix new auth implementation
2. **HIGH**: Run parallel testing (old vs new)
3. **MEDIUM**: Deploy to staging with monitoring
4. **LOW**: Begin Phase 2 (Upload) only after Phase 1 is stable

## 📞 Key Contacts & Resources

### Documentation
- Architecture: `/backend_architecture_redesign.md`
- Migration Plan: `/backend_migration_plan.md`
- Sprint Status: `/SPRINT_004_STATUS.md`

### Code Locations
- Old Auth: `backend/app/api/auth.py`
- New Auth: `backend/app/features/auth/`
- Infrastructure: `backend/app/infrastructure/`
- Config: `backend/app/core/config.py` (line 180-191 for feature flags)

### Monitoring Points
- Check logs for "Using NEW auth implementation" vs "Using OLD auth implementation"
- Monitor error rates when switching feature flags
- Track response times (new should be within 10% of old)

## ⚠️ Critical Warnings

1. **DO NOT** set `USE_NEW_AUTH=true` in production until fully tested
2. **DO NOT** remove old auth code until new auth is stable for 72+ hours
3. **ALWAYS** test with feature flag off first, then on
4. **MONITOR** closely during any feature flag changes

## 🔄 Migration Philosophy

We're following the **Strangler Fig Pattern**:
- Build new alongside old
- No breaking changes
- Gradual migration with feature flags
- Instant rollback capability
- Remove old only after new is proven

This ensures **zero downtime** and **low risk** throughout the migration.

**For questions about this migration**, refer to:
1. This status document
2. The migration plan (`backend_migration_plan.md`)
3. The architecture design (`backend_architecture_redesign.md`)

**Last Action Taken**: Created Phase 1 auth structure with feature flags, but new implementation is NOT tested or active yet.

**Next Required Action**: Test new auth implementation and fix any issues before proceeding.
