# GCP Cloud Run Deployment - Interim Status Report

**Date:** October 7, 2025
**Branch:** `feature/gcp-cloud-deployment`
**Status:** 90% Complete - One Outstanding Issue

---

## Executive Summary

The AI Resume Review platform has been successfully deployed to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) using Cloud Run. Both frontend and backend services are operational and accessible. However, there is one remaining issue with the frontend making HTTP requests instead of HTTPS to the backend API.

**Deployment URLs:**
- **Frontend:** https://ai-resume-review-v2-frontend-prod-864523342928.us-central1.run.app
- **Backend API:** https://ai-resume-review-v2-backend-prod-wnjxxf534a-uc.a.run.app
- **API Docs:** https://ai-resume-review-v2-backend-prod-wnjxxf534a-uc.a.run.app/docs

## ⚠️ Outstanding Issue

### Mixed Content Error (HTTP vs HTTPS)

**Status:** Unresolved
**Priority:** HIGH
**Impact:** Prevents full frontend functionality (upload page, API calls fail)

**Problem:**
The frontend browser console shows:
```
Mixed Content: The page at 'https://ai-resume-review-v2-frontend-prod-864523342928.us-central1.run.app/upload'
was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure XMLHttpRequest endpoint
'http://ai-resume-review-v2-backend-prod-wnjxxf534a-uc.a.run.app/api/v1/candidates/'.
This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
```

**What We've Tried:**
1. ✅ Added `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` as Docker build argument
2. ✅ Updated Dockerfile to accept and use build arg
3. ✅ Fixed CORS configuration in backend
4. ✅ Verified HTTPS URL in built JavaScript bundles
5. ✅ Added `--no-cache` flag to prevent Docker layer caching
6. ✅ Redeployed multiple times with fresh builds
7. ✅ Verified image digests are different after rebuild
8. ✅ Checked deployed JavaScript - contains HTTPS URLs

**Current Investigation:**
- The deployed JavaScript bundles contain the correct HTTPS URL
- The new revision (00004-fdq) uses a fresh image
- Yet the browser still makes HTTP requests
- User performed hard refresh multiple times

**Possible Root Causes:**
1. **Browser cache persisting beyond hard refresh** - May need incognito mode test
2. **Service Worker caching** - Next.js may have registered a service worker
3. **CDN/Edge caching** - Cloud Run might be caching responses
4. **Environment variable override at runtime** - Something might be overriding the build-time value
5. **Multiple JavaScript chunks** - One chunk might have stale code

**Next Steps to Debug:**
1. Test in browser incognito/private mode
2. Check for registered service workers in DevTools → Application → Service Workers
3. Clear all site data in browser (DevTools → Application → Clear storage)
4. Check all JavaScript chunks for HTTP URLs:
   ```bash
   curl -s https://.../\_next/static/chunks/*.js | grep "http://ai-resume"
   ```
5. Add logging to see what URL the client-side code is actually using
6. Consider adding a unique query parameter to force cache invalidation

## Cost Estimate

**Monthly Costs (Approximate):**
- Cloud SQL (db-f1-micro): ~$25/month
- Cloud Run Backend: ~$10/month (scales to zero)
- Cloud Run Frontend: ~$10/month (scales to zero)
- VPC Connector: ~$10/month
- Artifact Registry: ~$5/month
- **Total: ~$60/month** (excluding AI API usage)

**Current Resource Usage:**
- Both services set to scale to zero when idle (cost optimization)
- Database always running (required)

2. **Test in incognito mode** to bypass all caching
3. **Check browser DevTools** → Network tab to see actual request URLs
4. **Consider alternative solutions:**
   - Force HTTPS redirect at Cloud Run level
   - Add Content Security Policy headers
   - Investigate Next.js configuration for base URL

### Short Term (Once Fixed)
1. **Complete integration testing**
   - Test file upload
   - Test AI analysis
   - Verify all CRUD operations
2. **Update HANDOVER.md** with final status
3. **Change admin passwords** from defaults
4. **Merge to main branch** and push to origin

### Medium Term (Production Readiness)
1. **Set up monitoring:**
   - Cloud Monitoring dashboard
   - Uptime checks
   - Alert policies for errors/downtime
2. **Configure custom domain** (if needed)
3. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** (GitHub Actions)
4. **Add staging environment**
5. **Configure OpenAI API key** for AI features

### Long Term (Optimization)
1. Enable Cloud CDN for static assets
2. Implement Redis for rate limiting
3. Add comprehensive logging/tracing
4. Performance optimization
5. Security audit
