# Backlog Management System

This folder contains all project management and task tracking documents for the AI Resume Review Platform.

## Files Overview

### üìã [BACKLOG_TEMPLATE.md](./BACKLOG_TEMPLATE.md)
Template for creating new backlog items with proper formatting and required fields.

### üìù [PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md](./PRODUCT_BACKLOG.md) 
Complete product backlog with all user stories, technical tasks, and epics organized by sprint.

### üìä [BACKLOG_STATUS.md](./BACKLOG_STATUS.md)
Live status tracker showing progress across all sprints and items.

## How to Use This System

### 1. **Starting Development**
- Review the Product Backlog to understand all required work
- Begin with Sprint 1 items in priority order
- Update status from "Not Started" ‚Üí "In Progress" ‚Üí "Done"

### 2. **Adding New Items**
- Use the Backlog Template format
- Assign appropriate ID (STORY-XX, TASK-XX, etc.)
- Add to Product Backlog in priority order
- Update Status Tracker

### 3. **Tracking Progress**
- Update BACKLOG_STATUS.md as you complete items
- Track velocity to improve planning
- Review and adjust priorities as needed

### 4. **Sprint Planning**
- Each sprint is designed to be 1-2 weeks of work
- Sprint 1-2: Foundation (must complete first)
- Sprint 3-4: Core AI functionality
- Sprint 5-6: User interface
- Sprint 7-8: Production deployment

## Backlog Item Types

- **EPIC-XX**: Large features spanning multiple sprints
- **STORY-XX**: User-focused functionality
- **TASK-XX**: Technical implementation work
- **BUG-XX**: Issue fixes (add as needed)

## Priority Guidelines

- **High**: Must have for MVP launch
- **Medium**: Should have, can be postponed if needed
- **Low**: Nice to have, future enhancement

## Effort Estimation

- **XS (1-2h)**: Quick fixes, simple config
- **S (3-8h)**: Single component or endpoint
- **M (1-2d)**: Complex feature, multiple files
- **L (3-5d)**: Major functionality
- **XL (1w+)**: Large epic or complex integration

## Tips for Success

1. **Start Small**: Begin with Sprint 1 foundation items
2. **Follow Dependencies**: Don't skip prerequisite tasks
3. **Test Early**: Validate each component works before moving on
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep status tracker current
5. **Adjust as Needed**: Backlog is living document, update priorities
