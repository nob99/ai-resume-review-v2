# Backend Upload Error - Handover Document

## Issue Summary
**Status:** Frontend ✅ Fixed | Backend ❌ Error
**Date:** September 27, 2025
**Frontend Fix Completed By:** Frontend Team
**Backend Fix Required:** Yes - Critical

## Problem Description
The file upload feature is experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error in the backend, preventing users from uploading resumes. The frontend has been successfully fixed and is now correctly sending files as multipart/form-data.

## Current State

### ✅ Frontend (FIXED)
- Successfully sending files as `multipart/form-data`
- Proper Content-Type header with boundary
- File binary data correctly transmitted
- Verified working with 35KB PDF test file

### ❌ Backend (ERROR)
- Receiving file data correctly
- Crashing during processing with AttributeError
- Error: `'ResumeUploadRepository' object has no attribute 'db'`

## Error Details

### Endpoint
```
POST /api/v1/resume_upload/candidates/{candidate_id}/resumes
```

### Error Log
```

```

### HTTP Response
```
Status: 500 Internal Server Error
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The `ResumeUploadRepository` class is attempting to access a `db` attribute that doesn't exist. This suggests one of the following issues:

1. **Missing dependency injection** - The repository isn't receiving the database session
2. **Incorrect attribute name** - Should be `self.session` or `self._db` instead of `self.db`
3. **Missing initialization** - The `__init__` method isn't properly setting up the db attribute

## Files to Investigate

1. **Primary Investigation:**
   - `backend/app/features/resume_upload/repository.py` - Check ResumeUploadRepository class
   - `backend/app/features/resume_upload/service.py` - Check how repository is instantiated
   - `backend/app/features/resume_upload/api.py:39-94` - Check dependency injection

2. **Related Files:**
   - `backend/app/core/database.py` or `backend/database/connection.py` - Database session management
   - Other repository implementations for reference pattern

## Suggested Fix Approach

1. **Check Repository Initialization**
   ```python
   # Current (likely incorrect):
   class ResumeUploadRepository:
       def some_method(self):
           self.db.query(...)  # Error here

   # Should probably be:
   class ResumeUploadRepository:
       def __init__(self, db: Session):
           self.db = db  # or self.session = db
   ```

2. **Verify Dependency Injection**
   ```python
   # In api.py or service.py
   repository = ResumeUploadRepository(db=get_db())  # Ensure db is passed
   ```

3. **Check Other Working Repositories**
   - Compare with auth or candidate repositories that are working
   - Follow the same pattern for database access

## Test Data

### Working Test Case
- **User:** admin@example.com
- **Candidate ID:** 1b36c029-b9f0-413e-8fc2-8c2e43d37630
- **Test File:** 福元(飛行機領収書).pdf (35KB PDF)
- **Frontend Request:** Verified sending correct multipart/form-data

### Expected Behavior
1. File should be received by backend ✅
2. File should be validated ❌ (crashes before this)
3. File should be processed and saved
4. Response should return success with file metadata

## Verification Steps After Fix

1. **Unit Test:** Test ResumeUploadRepository with mock database session
2. **Integration Test:** Test full upload flow with test file
3. **Manual Test:**
   - Login as admin@example.com
   - Navigate to upload page
   - Select candidate from dropdown
   - Upload PDF file
   - Verify success response

## Additional Context

- All other API endpoints are working (auth, candidates)
- Database connections are healthy for other features
- This appears to be isolated to the resume_upload feature
- Frontend was sending JSON instead of multipart/form-data (now fixed)

## Priority
**HIGH** - Core functionality blocker preventing resume uploads
