# Handover Documents Archive - October 13, 2025

This folder contains the complete handover documentation from the Terraform migration and deployment improvement project.

## Document Timeline

These documents chronicle a 6-session journey from "broken CORS in production" to "complete Infrastructure as Code":

### V1 - CORS Implementation (Oct 12, 2025)
**File:** [HANDOVER_CORS_IMPLEMENTATION.md](HANDOVER_CORS_IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- **Problem:** Production CORS errors due to hardcoded URLs
- **Solution:** Dynamic CORS configuration from environment variables
- **Status:** Code fixed, but deployment system broken

### V2 - Deployment Fix (Oct 13, 2025)
**File:** [HANDOVER_DEPLOYMENT_FIX_V2.md](HANDOVER_DEPLOYMENT_FIX_V2.md)
- **Problem:** CI/CD deployments failing - container won't start
- **Root Cause:** GitHub Actions losing environment variables
- **Solution:** Unified deployment with all config in YAML
- **Status:** 95% complete, missing one secret

### V3 - Complete Deployment Fix (Oct 13, 2025)
**File:** [HANDOVER_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE_V3.md](HANDOVER_DEPLOYMENT_COMPLETE_V3.md)
- **Critical Bug:** Staging was connecting to production database!
- **Root Cause:** Variable name mismatch
- **Solution:** Fixed database connection, created missing secret
- **Status:** Staging working, production needs deployment

### V4 - Phase 1 Deployment Safety (Oct 13, 2025)
**File:** [HANDOVER_PHASE1_COMPLETE_V4.md](HANDOVER_PHASE1_COMPLETE_V4.md)
- **Problem:** Environment detection bug (wrong deployment target)
- **Solution:** 5 safety improvements (validation, isolation, smoke tests)
- **Status:** Production working, Phase 2 roadmap defined

### V5 - Terraform Staging Import (Oct 13, 2025)
**File:** [HANDOVER_TERRAFORM_MIGRATION_V5.md](HANDOVER_TERRAFORM_MIGRATION_V5.md)
- **Problem:** "No single source of truth, configuration scattered"
- **Solution:** Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- **Achievement:** Imported 11 staging resources (zero downtime)
- **Status:** Staging under Terraform control

### V6 - Terraform Production Import (Oct 13, 2025)
**File:** [HANDOVER_TERRAFORM_COMPLETE_V6.md](HANDOVER_TERRAFORM_COMPLETE_V6.md)
- **Achievement:** Imported 11 production resources (zero downtime)
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Both environments managed by Terraform
- **Outcome:** Single source of truth established

## Supporting Documentation

### Terraform Phase 1 Complete
**File:** [TERRAFORM_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md](TERRAFORM_PHASE1_COMPLETE.md)
- Detailed technical documentation of Terraform Phase 1
- Staging environment import process
- Configuration and troubleshooting guide

## Key Outcomes

**Problems Solved:**
1. ✅ CORS configuration (V1)
2. ✅ Deployment system reliability (V2, V3)
3. ✅ Database connection bug (V3)
4. ✅ Environment isolation (V4)
5. ✅ Configuration scattered (V5, V6)

**Infrastructure as Code Achievement:**
- 22 resources imported total (11 staging + 11 production)
- Zero downtime across all migrations
- Single source of truth: `config/environments.yml`
- Complete audit trail in Git
- Drift detection enabled

## How to Read These Documents

**For Understanding the Journey:**
Read in order: V1 → V2 → V3 → V4 → V5 → V6

**For Terraform Implementation:**
Read V5 (staging) and V6 (production)

**For Current State:**
Read V6 (has complete summary of entire journey)

## Current Infrastructure State

As of October 13, 2025:
- ✅ Both staging and production fully managed by Terraform
- ✅ All configuration in `config/environments.yml`
- ✅ Drift detection with `terraform plan`
- ✅ Zero manual GCP Console changes needed

See current documentation:
- [Root README.md](../../README.md)
- [terraform/README.md](../../terraform/README.md)
- [config/README.md](../../config/README.md)
- [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md)
