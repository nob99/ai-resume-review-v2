## üé® Frontend Team Guidelines {#frontend-team}

### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY: Architecture Patterns
**All frontend engineers MUST follow the patterns documented in `frontend/README.md`**

### Critical Rules

#### 1. Separation of Concerns
**‚úÖ API Layer (`src/lib/api.ts`)**:
- Make HTTP requests
- Handle token refresh
- Transform errors to typed classes
- Return `ApiResult<T>` pattern
- **NEVER handle navigation or UI logic**

**‚úÖ UI Layer (Components/Context)**:
- Handle navigation decisions
- Display appropriate UI feedback
- Manage local state
- Use auth context for auth state

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN**:
```typescript
// NEVER do this in api.ts
window.location.href = '/login'  // VIOLATES separation of concerns
```

#### 2. Error Handling
Use custom error types:
- `AuthExpiredError` - Session expired
- `AuthInvalidError` - Invalid credentials
- `NetworkError` - Connection issues

#### 3. Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Forms**: React Hook Form
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
- **API Client**: Axios with interceptors

### Development Standards

#### TypeScript
- No `any` types
- Define interfaces for all data
- Use strict null checks
- Proper error boundaries

#### Component Guidelines
- Use design system components (`src/components/ui/`)
- Follow existing patterns
- Handle loading states
- Implement proper accessibility

#### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for logic
- Integration tests for user flows
- Minimum 80% coverage
- Mock API layer properly

#### Performance Standards
- Page load < 3 seconds
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Optimize bundle size
- Lazy load when appropriate

---

## ‚ö° Backend Team Guidelines {#backend-team}

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Redis
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Testing**: pytest
- **Documentation**: OpenAPI 3.0

### API Development Standards

#### 1. API Design
- **MUST follow OpenAPI 3.0 specification**
- Document in `docs/api/openapi.yaml` BEFORE implementation
- REST endpoints: `/api/v1/resource-name`
- Use kebab-case for URLs
- Use camelCase for JSON properties

#### 2. FastAPI Patterns
```python
@router.post("/resource", response_model=ResourceResponse)
async def create_resource(
    resource_data: ResourceCreate,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    """Always include docstring with endpoint description."""
    pass
```

### Database Standards

#### 1. Development Process
- **MUST create ER diagrams** before database changes
- **üìñ Database Documentation**: See `database/README.md` for complete schema, setup, and migration guide
- Use migration scripts for all changes
- Never modify database directly in production

#### 2. Configuration Management
- **üîê NEVER hardcode credentials**
- Use centralized config from `app.core.config`
- Required setup:
  ```bash
  cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
  # Edit .env with your local values
  ```

#### 3. Timezone Handling
- **üåç ALWAYS use timezone-aware datetimes**
- **‚ùå NEVER use `datetime.utcnow()`**
- **‚úÖ Use `app.core.datetime_utils.utc_now()`**
- Store ALL timestamps in UTC
- Use `DateTime(timezone=True)` in models

### Python Standards
- Follow PEP 8
- Use type hints
- Format with Black
- Lint with pylint/flake8
- Docstrings for all public functions

### Testing Requirements
- pytest for all tests
- Minimum 80% coverage
- Unit tests with mocking
- Integration tests with real database
- Organize by user story: `tests/auth/AUTH-001_user_login/`

### Security Patterns
- Bcrypt for password hashing (12 rounds)
- JWT tokens with proper expiration
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization

- Security scanning on all images
- Use official base images

### Environment Management

- Production: GCP with Terraform
- Use secrets management (GCP Secret Manager)

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Run tests on every PR
- Security scanning included
- Automated deployment to staging

### Monitoring & Logging

- Centralized log aggregation
- Application performance monitoring
- Alert on critical metrics

### Database Operations

# Store prompts in separate files
RESUME_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
Analyze the following resume and provide structured feedback:
...
"""
```

### Testing AI Components
- Unit tests for data processing
- Integration tests with mock LLMs
- Performance benchmarks
- Quality evaluation metrics
