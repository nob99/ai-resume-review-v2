## 🏗️ Technical Architecture for Sprint 2

### Frontend Stack
```
Next.js 14 (App Router)
├── TypeScript (strict mode)
├── Tailwind CSS (utility-first styling)  
├── React Hook Form (form management)
├── Axios (API client)
└── Jest + React Testing Library (testing)
```

### Backend Enhancements
```
FastAPI (existing from Sprint 1)
├── JWT token management
├── API versioning (/api/v1/)
├── CORS middleware for frontend
├── Rate limiting with Redis
└── OpenAPI documentation
```

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User enters credentials → Frontend validation
2. POST /api/v1/auth/login → JWT token response
3. Token stored securely → httpOnly cookies
4. Protected routes → Token validation middleware
5. Auto-refresh → Seamless user experience
```

## 🔧 Development Environment Setup

### For Frontend Developers
```bash
# Clone and switch to sprint-002 branch
git clone [repo-url]
git checkout sprint-002

# Frontend setup (new this sprint)
cd frontend  # Will be created this sprint
npm install
npm run dev

# Environment variables needed
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### For Backend Developers  
```bash
# Existing backend from Sprint 1
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Already includes all dependencies

# New environment variables for JWT
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=15
JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS=7
```

## 📝 Team Responsibilities & Coordination

### Frontend Developer
**Primary Focus**: Build React/Next.js foundation and UI components
- [ ] Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind
- [ ] Create authentication components (login form, logout button)
- [ ] Build design system components (Button, Input, Card, etc.)
- [ ] Implement protected routing and auth guards
- [ ] Connect to backend APIs with proper error handling

### Backend Developer
**Primary Focus**: Extend existing FastAPI with authentication APIs
- [ ] Build on Sprint 1's AUTH-004 password security
- [ ] Implement JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Add session management with refresh tokens
- [ ] Create rate limiting and security middleware
- [ ] Document APIs with OpenAPI specifications

### Coordination Points
- **API Contract**: Define authentication endpoints early (Day 1-2)
- **Component Integration**: Frontend components match backend response format
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error messages between frontend/backend
- **Security Review**: JWT implementation follows best practices

## 🎯 Key Deliverables & Demo Preparation

### Sprint 2 Demo Items
1. **End-to-End Authentication**: Complete login → protected page → logout flow
2. **UI Component Showcase**: Design system components working responsively  
3. **Security Features**: Token refresh, rate limiting, session management
4. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid credentials, expired tokens
5. **Responsive Design**: Application working on mobile, tablet, desktop

### Success Metrics
- **Functional**: 100% of authentication user stories working
- **Performance**: Login response time < 500ms
- **Security**: JWT tokens properly secured and validated
