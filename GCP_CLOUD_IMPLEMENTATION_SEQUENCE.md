# GCP Cloud Implementation Sequence

**Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-06
**Status**: Ready to Implement

---

## 🎯 Recommended Implementation Order

### **Phase 1: Setup Scripts (Foundation)** - Week 1

| Priority | Script | Purpose | Time | Risk |
|----------|--------|---------|------|------|
| 🔥 **1** | `scripts/gcp/setup-gcp-project.sh` | Create GCP project, enable APIs, service accounts | 2-3h | Low |
| 🔥 **2** | `scripts/gcp/setup-cloud-sql.sh` | Create PostgreSQL database instances | 3-4h | Low |
| 🔥 **3** | `scripts/gcp/setup-secrets.sh` | Store secrets in Secret Manager | 1-2h | Low |

**Why this order?**
- Foundation first - everything depends on these
- One-time setup (run once, never again)
- No dependencies between them (after project setup)
- Easy to test and verify

---

### **Phase 2: Manual Deployment** - Week 2

| Priority | Script | Purpose | Time | Risk |
|----------|--------|---------|------|------|
| ⭐ **4** | `scripts/gcp/deploy-to-staging.sh` | Deploy application to staging | 4-6h | Medium |
| ⭐ **5** | `scripts/gcp/run-migrations.sh` | Run database migrations | 2-3h | Low |
| ⭐ **6** | `scripts/gcp/deploy-to-production.sh` | Deploy to production (with safety checks) | 2-3h | High |
| ⭐ **7** | `scripts/gcp/rollback.sh` | Rollback failed deployments | 1-2h | Low |

**Why this order?**
- Test deployment manually before automating
- Staging first, production later
- Rollback as safety net
- Easier to debug than automation

---

### **Phase 3: Automation (CI/CD)** - Week 3

| Priority | Workflow | Purpose | Time | Risk |
|----------|----------|---------|------|------|
| 💚 **8** | `.github/workflows/test.yml` | Run tests on every PR | 1-2h | Low |
| 💚 **9** | `.github/workflows/deploy-staging.yml` | Auto-deploy to staging | 2-3h | Low |
| 💚 **10** | `.github/workflows/deploy-production.yml` | Manual deploy to production | 1-2h | Medium |
| 💚 **11** | `.github/workflows/rollback.yml` | Automated rollback | 1h | Low |

**Why this order?**
- Automate what you've already tested manually
- Lower risk (manual deployment still works)
- Can reference manual scripts

---

### **Phase 4: Configuration** - Throughout

| Priority | File | Purpose | When |
|----------|------|---------|------|
| 📝 **12** | `deployment/configs/cloud-run-*.yaml` | Fill in actual Cloud Run settings | During Phase 2 |
| 📝 **13** | `deployment/configs/.env.staging` | Create from .example | Before Phase 2 |
| 📝 **14** | `deployment/configs/.env.production` | Create from .example | Before Phase 2 |

## 📅 Timeline

### **Week 1: Foundation**
- Day 1-2: Implement `setup-gcp-project.sh`
- Day 2-3: Implement `setup-cloud-sql.sh`
- Day 3-4: Implement `setup-secrets.sh`
- Day 4-5: Test all setup scripts, verify infrastructure

### **Week 2: Deployment**
- Day 1-3: Implement `deploy-to-staging.sh`
- Day 3-4: Implement `run-migrations.sh` and `deploy-to-production.sh`
- Day 4-5: Implement `rollback.sh`, test all deployment scripts

### **Week 3: Automation (Optional for MVP)**
- Day 1-3: Implement GitHub Actions workflows
- Day 4-5: Documentation, team training

**Total Time**: 2-3 weeks (20-30 hours)

## 🚀 Quick Start Path (Minimal Viable Deployment)

If you need to deploy quickly:

```bash
# Minimum Required Steps (1 week)
1. setup-gcp-project.sh       # Required
2. setup-cloud-sql.sh          # Required
3. setup-secrets.sh            # Required
4. deploy-to-staging.sh        # Required
5. Manual production deploy    # Skip automation

# Skip for MVP (add later)
- deploy-to-production.sh      # Deploy manually instead
- rollback.sh                  # Rollback via GCP Console
- run-migrations.sh            # Run migrations manually
- All GitHub Actions           # Deploy manually
```

---

## 🔗 Dependencies

```
setup-gcp-project.sh
    ↓ (creates project, enables APIs)
setup-cloud-sql.sh
    ↓ (creates database)
setup-secrets.sh
    ↓ (stores API keys)
deploy-to-staging.sh
    ↓ (deploys application)
run-migrations.sh
    ↓ (updates schema)
deploy-to-production.sh
    ↓ (production deployment)
GitHub Actions
    (automates above)
```

## 💡 Why This Order?

### **Setup Scripts First**
- ✅ Foundation for everything else
- ✅ No dependencies (can start immediately)
- ✅ One-time setup
- ✅ Low risk

### **Manual Deployment Second**
- ✅ Test the process before automating
- ✅ Easier to debug
- ✅ Learn what works
- ✅ Iterate quickly

### **Automation Last**
- ✅ Automate what you understand
- ✅ Lower risk (manual still works)
- ✅ Optional for MVP

---

## 🎯 Key Principles

1. **Foundation First** - Can't deploy without infrastructure
2. **Manual Before Automation** - Test before automating
3. **Staging Before Production** - Validate in safe environment
4. **Safety Nets Early** - Rollback ready before production
5. **Iterate and Learn** - Each phase builds on previous

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

- ❌ Don't start with GitHub Actions (automate later)
- ❌ Don't skip setup scripts (foundation required)
- ❌ Don't deploy to production first (test in staging)
- ❌ Don't implement everything at once (too complex)
