# GitHub Actions Workflow: Deploy to GCP Production Environment
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Deploy the application to GCP Cloud Run production environment with
#   manual approval step for safety.
#
# TRIGGER:
#   - Manual trigger only (workflow_dispatch)
#   - Requires approval from designated approvers
#
# WORKFLOW STEPS:
#   1. Checkout code from 'main' branch only
#   2. Verify staging deployment is healthy
#   3. Wait for manual approval (GitHub Environments feature)
#   4. Authenticate with GCP using Workload Identity
#   5. Pull Docker images from Artifact Registry (built in staging)
#   6. Deploy frontend to Cloud Run (production)
#   7. Deploy backend to Cloud Run (production)
#   8. Run smoke tests against production
#   9. Monitor for 30 minutes (automated health checks)
#   10. Send notification to Slack
#   11. If issues detected: Trigger rollback workflow
#
# REQUIRED SECRETS:
#   - GCP_PROJECT_ID: Google Cloud project ID
#   - GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER: Workload Identity provider
#   - GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT: Service account email
#   - SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL: Slack webhook for notifications
#   - PAGERDUTY_API_KEY: PagerDuty API key (for critical alerts)
#
# ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
#   - REGION: us-central1
#   - PROD_FRONTEND_SERVICE: ai-resume-review-frontend-prod
#   - PROD_BACKEND_SERVICE: ai-resume-review-backend-prod
#
# SAFETY FEATURES:
#   - Manual approval required (GitHub Environments)
#   - Production branch protection (main branch only)
#   - Smoke tests before marking deployment complete
#   - Automated rollback on failure
#   - Notifications to team on deployment status
#
# DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
#   - Safety first: Multiple approval gates
#   - Reuse artifacts: Use images built in staging
#   - Smoke test everything: Verify before marking complete
#   - Monitor actively: Watch metrics for 30 minutes
#   - Fast rollback: One-click rollback to previous version
#
# APPROVAL PROCESS:
#   1. Developer triggers workflow
#   2. GitHub notifies designated approvers
#   3. Approver reviews staging environment
#   4. Approver approves or rejects deployment
#   5. If approved, deployment proceeds
#   6. If rejected, workflow stops
#
# ROLLBACK STRATEGY:
#   - Cloud Run maintains previous revisions
#   - Rollback = redirect traffic to previous revision
#   - Rollback time: < 2 minutes
#   - Zero downtime during rollback
#
# NEXT STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
#   1. Set up GitHub Environments (staging, production)
#   2. Configure required reviewers for production
#   3. Implement smoke test scripts
#   4. Set up monitoring alerts
#   5. Document rollback procedures
