# GitHub Actions Workflow: Rollback Production Deployment
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Quickly rollback production deployment to previous working version
#   in case of critical issues or bugs.
#
# TRIGGER:
#   - Manual trigger only (workflow_dispatch)
#   - Can also be triggered automatically by monitoring alerts
#
# WORKFLOW STEPS:
#   1. Verify current production revision
#   2. List available previous revisions
#   3. Wait for manual confirmation (which revision to rollback to)
#   4. Authenticate with GCP
#   5. Update Cloud Run traffic routing:
#      - Route 100% traffic to previous revision
#      - Keep current revision for investigation
#   6. Verify rollback successful (health checks)
#   7. Send notification to team
#   8. Create incident report issue in GitHub
#
# INPUTS (workflow_dispatch):
#   - target_revision: Revision ID to rollback to (optional)
#   - environment: staging or production
#   - reason: Reason for rollback (required)
#
# REQUIRED SECRETS:
#   - GCP_PROJECT_ID
#   - GCP_WORKLOAD_IDENTITY_PROVIDER
#   - GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
#   - SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
#
# ROLLBACK STRATEGY:
#   Cloud Run maintains last 1000 revisions:
#     - Each deployment creates a new revision
#     - Traffic can be routed to any revision
#     - Rollback = change traffic from revision N to revision N-1
#     - Zero downtime (gradual traffic shift)
#
# SAFETY CHECKS:
#   1. Confirm target revision exists
#   2. Verify target revision was previously healthy
#   3. Manual confirmation required
#   4. Health checks after rollback
#   5. Automatic rollback if health checks fail
#
# DESIGN PRINCIPLES:
#   - Fast rollback: Complete in < 2 minutes
#   - Safe rollback: Multiple verification steps
#   - Zero downtime: Gradual traffic shifting
#   - Audit trail: Log all rollback actions
#   - Investigation friendly: Keep failed revision for debugging
#
# ROLLBACK TIMELINE:
#   T+0:00 - Trigger rollback workflow
#   T+0:30 - Verify target revision
#   T+1:00 - Start traffic shift (0% â†’ 100%)
#   T+1:30 - Monitor health checks
#   T+2:00 - Rollback complete, send notifications
#
# POST-ROLLBACK ACTIONS:
#   1. Create incident report
#   2. Investigate root cause
#   3. Fix issue in code
#   4. Test fix in staging
#   5. Deploy fix to production
#
# NEXT STEPS FOR IMPLEMENTATION:
#   1. Document revision naming convention
#   2. Set up automated health checks
#   3. Create incident report template
#   4. Test rollback in staging environment
