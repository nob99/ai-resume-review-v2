# Rollback Deployment Script
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Quickly rollback a Cloud Run deployment to the previous working version.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/gcp/rollback.sh [staging|production] [optional: revision-id]
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
#   1. Verify which environment to rollback
#   2. List current and previous revisions
#   3. Display revision details (deployed time, who deployed, etc.)
#   4. Prompt for confirmation
#   5. Update Cloud Run traffic routing:
#      - 100% traffic to previous revision
#      - Keep current revision for investigation
#   6. Verify rollback successful
#   7. Send notification to team
#   8. Create incident report
#
# ARGUMENTS:
#   $1: Environment (staging or production) - REQUIRED
#   $2: Target revision ID - OPTIONAL (defaults to previous revision)
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   # Rollback staging to previous revision
#   ./scripts/gcp/rollback.sh staging
#
#   # Rollback production to specific revision
#   ./scripts/gcp/rollback.sh production ai-resume-review-backend-prod-00012
#
# ROLLBACK PROCESS:
#   Cloud Run Traffic Management:
#     Current state:
#       - Revision N (current): 100% traffic
#       - Revision N-1 (previous): 0% traffic
#
#     After rollback:
#       - Revision N (current): 0% traffic (kept for debugging)
#       - Revision N-1 (previous): 100% traffic
#
#   Zero Downtime:
#     - Traffic gradually shifts (100% → 0%)
#     - No connection drops
#     - Rollback time: ~30-60 seconds
#
# SAFETY CHECKS:
#   1. Verify target revision exists
#   2. Confirm target revision was previously healthy
#   3. Show impact (how many users affected)
#   4. Require explicit confirmation
#   5. Health checks after rollback
#
# VERIFICATION STEPS:
#   After rollback:
#   1. Check health endpoints
#   2. Verify error rate decreased
#   3. Test key user flows
#   4. Monitor for 5 minutes
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   - Rollback confirmation
#   - New traffic routing (revision → percentage)
#   - Health check results
#   - Incident report link
#
# POST-ROLLBACK ACTIONS:
#   1. Notify team (Slack)
#   2. Create incident report issue
#   3. Investigate root cause
#   4. Fix issue in code
#   5. Test fix in staging
#   6. Deploy fix to production
#
# INCIDENT REPORT TEMPLATE:
#   Title: "[ROLLBACK] Production rollback - [date]"
#   Content:
#     - What happened
#     - When it happened
#     - Impact (users affected, duration)
#     - Rollback details
#     - Root cause (to be investigated)
#     - Action items
#
# NEXT STEPS:
#   1. Review logs for failed deployment
#   2. Reproduce issue locally
#   3. Create fix
#   4. Test in staging
#   5. Deploy fix with caution
