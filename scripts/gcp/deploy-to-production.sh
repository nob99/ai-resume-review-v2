# Deploy to GCP Production Script
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Manually deploy the application to GCP production environment with
#   safety checks and approval prompts.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/gcp/deploy-to-production.sh
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
#   1. Verify prerequisites
#   2. Check staging deployment is healthy
#   3. Display changes since last production deployment
#   4. Prompt for manual approval (REQUIRED)
#   5. Pull Docker images from staging (reuse same images)
#   6. Tag images for production
#   7. Deploy backend to Cloud Run (production)
#   8. Deploy frontend to Cloud Run (production)
#   9. Run database migrations (production)
#   10. Run comprehensive smoke tests
#   11. Monitor deployment for 5 minutes
#   12. Send success notification
#
# SAFETY FEATURES:
#   - Requires explicit confirmation before deploying
#   - Verifies staging is healthy first
#   - Shows git diff between staging and production
#   - Comprehensive smoke tests
#   - Monitoring period after deployment
#   - Automatic rollback on critical errors
#
# MANUAL APPROVAL PROMPTS:
#   1. "Staging deployment verified? (yes/no)"
#   2. "Review changes? (yes/no)"
#   3. "Ready to deploy to production? (yes/no)"
#   4. "Confirm production deployment? Type 'DEPLOY' to continue"
#
# CLOUD RUN CONFIGURATION (Production):
#   Backend:
#     - Service: ai-resume-review-backend-prod
#     - Memory: 2GB
#     - CPU: 2
#     - Min instances: 1 (avoid cold starts)
#     - Max instances: 20
#     - Concurrency: 20
#
#   Frontend:
#     - Service: ai-resume-review-frontend-prod
#     - Memory: 512MB
#     - CPU: 1
#     - Min instances: 0
#     - Max instances: 10
#     - Concurrency: 80
#
# SMOKE TESTS (Production):
#   1. Health check endpoints
#   2. Database connectivity
#   3. Secret Manager access
#   4. Login flow (test user)
#   5. Resume upload (test file)
#   6. AI analysis (test request)
#   7. Performance check (response time < 2s)
#
# MONITORING (5 minutes post-deployment):
#   - Error rate (should be < 1%)
#   - Latency (P95 < 2s)
#   - CPU usage (< 70%)
#   - Memory usage (< 80%)
#   - Active requests
#
# ROLLBACK TRIGGERS:
#   Automatic rollback if:
#   - Error rate > 5%
#   - Any smoke test fails
#   - Health checks fail
#   - Database connection errors
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   - Production URLs
#   - Deployment revision ID
#   - Smoke test results
#   - Monitoring dashboard link
#
# NEXT STEPS AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
#   1. Monitor Cloud Logging for errors
#   2. Check Cloud Monitoring dashboard
#   3. Verify user-facing features
#   4. Update team in Slack
#   5. Close deployment ticket
