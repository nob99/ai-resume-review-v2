# Database Migration Script (Alembic)
# ============================================================================
#
# PURPOSE:
#   Run database migrations on Cloud SQL instances using Alembic.
#
# USAGE:
#   ./scripts/gcp/run-migrations.sh [staging|production] [up|down|current]
#
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES:
#   1. Connect to Cloud SQL via Cloud SQL Proxy
#   2. Verify current database schema version
#   3. Show pending migrations
#   4. Prompt for confirmation
#   5. Run migrations:
#      - up: Upgrade to latest version
#      - down: Downgrade one version
#      - current: Show current version (no changes)
#   6. Verify migration successful
#   7. Display new schema version
#   8. Update migration log
#
# ARGUMENTS:
#   $1: Environment (staging or production) - REQUIRED
#   $2: Direction (up, down, current) - REQUIRED
#
# EXAMPLES:
#   # Run migrations on staging
#   ./scripts/gcp/run-migrations.sh staging up
#
#   # Rollback one migration on staging
#   ./scripts/gcp/run-migrations.sh staging down
#
#   # Check current version on production
#   ./scripts/gcp/run-migrations.sh production current
#
# MIGRATION PROCESS:
#   1. Alembic checks current database version
#   2. Compares with migration files in database/migrations/
#   3. Applies pending migrations in order
#   4. Updates alembic_version table
#   5. Logs migration history
#
# SAFETY FEATURES:
#   - Dry-run mode (show SQL without executing)
#   - Backup before migration (production only)
#   - Rollback on failure
#   - Require confirmation for production
#   - Lock table during migration (prevent concurrent changes)
#
# CONNECTION METHOD:
#   Uses Cloud SQL Proxy:
#     1. Start Cloud SQL Proxy
#     2. Connect via localhost:5432
#     3. Run migrations
#     4. Stop Cloud SQL Proxy
#
# ALEMBIC COMMANDS:
#   - alembic current: Show current revision
#   - alembic history: Show migration history
#   - alembic upgrade head: Upgrade to latest
#   - alembic downgrade -1: Downgrade one version
#   - alembic upgrade +1: Upgrade one version
#
# MIGRATION FILES LOCATION:
#   database/migrations/versions/*.py
#
# PREREQUISITES:
#   - Cloud SQL instance running
#   - Cloud SQL Proxy installed
#   - Database credentials in Secret Manager
#   - Alembic configured (database/alembic.ini)
#
# OUTPUTS:
#   - Current schema version
#   - Pending migrations (if any)
#   - Migration execution log
#   - New schema version
#
# ROLLBACK PROCEDURE:
#   If migration fails:
#   1. Alembic automatically rolls back
#   2. Database returns to previous state
#   3. Error logged
#   4. Notify team
#
# NEXT STEPS AFTER MIGRATION:
#   1. Verify application works with new schema
#   2. Run integration tests
#   3. Monitor for schema-related errors
#   4. Update schema documentation
