## Risks & Impediments

### Identified Risks
1. **Frontend Framework Learning Curve**: Team may need time to ramp up on React/Next.js
   - *Mitigation*: Start with simple components, pair programming sessions

2. **JWT Security Implementation**: Proper token handling is critical
   - *Mitigation*: Use established libraries, security review of auth flow

3. **UI/UX Consistency**: Design system needs to be comprehensive but not over-engineered
   - *Mitigation*: Start with minimal viable components, iterate based on usage

4. **Frontend-Backend Integration**: API contracts need to be well-defined
   - *Mitigation*: Create OpenAPI specification early, mock API for frontend development

### Current Impediments
- [ ] Frontend developer onboarding and environment setup
- [ ] Design mockups or wireframes for UI components
- [ ] Decision on CSS framework (Tailwind CSS vs Material-UI vs Custom)
