## Risks & Impediments

### Identified Risks
1. **GCP API Enablement Delays**: Some APIs may require organizational approval
   - *Mitigation*: Start API enablement process on Day 1
   
2. **Database Schema Changes**: Schema might need adjustments as we build
   - *Mitigation*: Use migration framework from the start

3. **LangChain Version Compatibility**: Rapid changes in LangChain ecosystem
   - *Mitigation*: Pin specific versions, document compatibility

### Current Impediments
- [ ] Waiting for GCP project approval
- [ ] OpenAI/Claude API keys not yet procured
