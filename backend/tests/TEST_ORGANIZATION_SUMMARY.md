â”œâ”€â”€ test_auth_login.py    # Duplicate? Different?
â”œâ”€â”€ test_security.py      # What feature?
â”œâ”€â”€ test_user_model.py    # Which story?
â””â”€â”€ test_agents.py
```

### After (Clear User Story Organization):
```

â”œâ”€â”€ auth/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AUTH-001_user_login/        âœ… Your current story!

## ðŸ“ˆ Sprint 2 Readiness

Empty folders are ready for Sprint 2 stories:

- `AUTH-003_session_management/` - Ready for session tests

When developers implement these stories, tests will go directly into the corresponding folders!
