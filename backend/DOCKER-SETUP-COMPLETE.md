# Backend Containerization - Complete ✅

## Summary

The AI Resume Review backend has been successfully containerized and is now running in Docker alongside the existing database services.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Multi-stage Dockerfile** ✅
- Created optimized Dockerfile with builder and production stages
- Reduced image size by separating build dependencies from runtime
- Non-root user security implementation
- Health check integration using existing `/health` endpoint

### 2. **Security & Best Practices** ✅
- `.dockerignore` file to exclude sensitive files and test code
- Non-root user (`appuser`) for container security
- Proper file permissions and ownership
- Environment variable configuration (no hardcoded secrets)

### 3. **Docker Compose Integration** ✅
- Added backend service to existing `docker-compose.dev.yml`
- Connected to existing network (`ai-resume-review-network`)
- Proper service dependencies with health checks
- Hot-reload enabled for development

### 4. **Configuration Management** ✅
- Fixed Redis configuration to use containerized Redis service
- Environment variables properly configured for container networking
- Database and Redis connections working correctly

### 5. **Production Ready Features** ✅
- Health checks for monitoring
- Graceful startup/shutdown with proper dependency waiting
- Structured logging maintained
- Entry point script for initialization

## Current Status

**All services running and healthy:**
- ✅ **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000 (containerized)
- ✅ **PostgreSQL**: localhost:5432 (containerized) 
- ✅ **Redis**: localhost:6379 (containerized)
- ✅ **PgAdmin**: http://localhost:8080 (containerized)

## Key Features Working

1. **API Endpoints**: All endpoints responding correctly
2. **Database Connection**: PostgreSQL connected and operational
3. **Redis Connection**: Rate limiter connected successfully
4. **Hot Reload**: Code changes trigger automatic restart
5. **Health Monitoring**: `/health` endpoint shows service status
6. **API Documentation**: Available at http://localhost:8000/docs

## How to Use

### Start All Services
```bash
cd /path/to/ai-resume-review-v2
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### View Logs
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f backend
```

### Stop Services
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

### Test API
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

## Next Steps for Production

When ready to deploy to GCP:

1. **Use production docker-compose or K8s manifests**
2. **Remove development volumes and hot-reload**
3. **Use GCP Secret Manager for sensitive config**
4. **Point to managed PostgreSQL (Cloud SQL)**
5. **Use managed Redis (Memorystore)**
6. **Add monitoring and logging aggregation**
